# npm3

Use npm v3 globally alongside whatever other version of `npm` you currently have installed.

Wraps the 'next' version of npm v3 as an executable `npm3`.

## Installation & Update

Remember to run this semi-regularly to get the latest version of npm v3.
```
npm install -g npm3
```

## Usage

The `npm3` executable behaves exactly like `npm`:

```
> npm3 -v
3.2.2
> npm3 install
> npm3 search
# etc
```
